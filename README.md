# Level_segmentation_Kmeans
This is my first segment level. In this level, i have segmented by this funnel:
- Filter user first open (to ensure every one start at the same point) (in 30 days)
- Caculate all the metrics like winrate, drop, exit_drop, arpu, adrw_per_user, booster_per_user
- Then segment level by Kmeans

The purpose of this segment level is to help gd arrange level properly
